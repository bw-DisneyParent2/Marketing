# WEB Unit 1 Build: Marketing Site for Project
It’s time to put all your fundamentals to the test. Being able to combine HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Libraries, and Programming Paradigms into a project is a rare skill indeed.

## The Web Foundations Unit explored the following topics:
1. User Interfaces 1 - 3
2. Git for Web Development
3. Responsive Design 1 - 2
4. Pre-Processors 1 - 2
5. JavaScript Fundamentals 1 - 4


For your project this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by working with a group of students cross-section to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) over the course of the week.

## Your primary role User Interface Developer:
- [ ] You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.
- [ ] Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the “Responsiveness” portion of your rubric for more information on this.
- [ ] The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.
- [ ] Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like “Netlify” or “Github Pages”.
- [ ] For this Marketing site’s home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on.
- [ ] Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.
- [ ] For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another’s socials/Github.


## Your Grading Rubric:
Please review this rubric and fully demonstrate an understanding of your product role by submitting a message to your Project Manager with questions you have.

# PROJECT DETAILS

## Name
Disney Parent

## PITCH
As a parent with small children, wouldn't you like to make your Disney Experience more fun and economical?  Disney Parent puts the tools in your hands to be able to swap childcare and stroller passes with other parents allowing you save money and enjoy the 'big-kid' rides.

## MVP
 1. An on-boarding process for parents.
 2. "Mock" (no real data will be used/transmitted) on-boarding process for a "fully licensed independent childcare contractor" (think Uber for short term childcare.) Nearby users of this type can be "contracted" by parents if no parents are nearby and available/willing to swap passes. 
 3. Ability to easily create and post a request (including meeting place/ride and time, and number of kids you have)
 4. Ability to easily edit / delete a question
 5. Ability for anyone to easily search / find posted requests (filter by time, location, general search)
 6. Ability for a second parent user to log in and respond to the request

## STRETCH
1. Use a notification API like Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) or Growl (http://growl.info/) for notifications when your request has been answered, or when new requests are posted.
2. Gamify the app so the Parents that swap their pass the most are ranked at the top a leaderboard.
3. UX: Collaborate on a portion or all of a Web MVP with any Web teammate. For example: File structuring, Git, Styles, Semantic elements, etc. Learn something new and practice cross-collaborating.
4. UX: UX: Write a blog post in medium about your visual design decisions for this project; share the link in your Google Doc.
